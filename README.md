# JokeMemo
Svelte-rewrite of my small personal project JokeMemo, which allows keeping for "book" of jokes on your browser!

Please do note: I am not creating this for a amazing new website which should gather hundreds of users! It is simply a learning project for me and hopefully might reach a state where it has some fun use cases.

## Why rewrite? 
Okay, rewrite might be a bit of a stretch. It still uses a lot of old code I just adjusted to Svelte logic.
It might've been a bit too much of a learning curve to learn Svelte and do everything 10x better at the same time so I just rewrote some parts of the code base and I am planning to add lot more.

I spent a lot of time on this today as of initial commiting and it is as good as original html/css/js version, most likely even better from all my improved
coding skills since working on the OG project and the **speed and simplicity of Svelte**.

I wanted to learn Svelte and do it in a fun way. I felt like my original project on this was such a mess, thus "rewriting" felt like the only real thing to do.

## Current state
Still extremely barebones. Almost no css work has been made but that shall improve and look very beautiful!!!
