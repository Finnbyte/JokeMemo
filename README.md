# JokeMemo
Svelte-rewrite of my small personal project JokeMemo, which allows keeping for "book" of jokes on your browser!

Please do note: I am not creating this for a amazing new website which should gather hundreds of users! It is simply a learning project for me and hopefully might reach a state where it has some fun use cases.

## Why rewrite? 
I spent a lot of time on this today as of initial commiting and it is as good as original html/css/js version, most likely even better from all my improved
coding skills since working on the OG project and the **speed and simplicity of Svelte**.

I wanted to learn Svelte and do it in a fun way. I felt like my original project on this was such a mess, thus rewriting felt like the only real thing to do.

## Current state
Still extremely barebones. Almost no css work has been made but that shall improve!!!
